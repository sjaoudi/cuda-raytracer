We have now written the core of the phong lighting model (basically we've replicated the raytracing part of the midterm).
There is at least one bug in this code, and we are having trouble debugging it, especially as our debugging changes have 
not frequently produced the output we expected. 

Next steps are:
1. Debug
2. Get assimp up and running (so that we can draw more interesting things than our current one triangle).
